# CSV Data Processor

## Overview

A web application for processing CSV files containing location and business search queries. Users upload CSV files with keywords, brands, and branch information, which are then used to search Google Places API. The system performs brand matching on results and provides comprehensive downloadable reports in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel).

The application is designed with a clean, productivity-focused interface inspired by modern tools like Linear and Dropbox, emphasizing clarity and efficiency in data processing workflows.

**November 15, 2025 - Replit Environment Setup Completed:**
- Successfully set up GitHub import in Replit environment
- Installed all 492 npm dependencies
- Configured SERPER_API_KEY environment secret for Google Places API integration
- Created development workflow running `npm run dev` on port 5000 with webview output
- Configured autoscale deployment with build (`npm run build`) and run (`npm run start`) commands
- Verified application fully functional: CSV upload interface, country/language selectors, theme toggle
- Vite configuration already optimized for Replit proxy with `allowedHosts: true` and HMR settings
- Server configured to bind to 0.0.0.0:5000 for frontend access
- All existing features working: real-time SSE progress tracking, brand matching, file previews, downloads

**November 15, 2025 - Fixed SSE Progress Tracking:**
- Fixed Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming to properly display real-time progress
- Added `res.flushHeaders()` to ensure browser immediately recognizes streaming response
- Added `req.socket.setNoDelay(true)` to disable TCP buffering (Nagle's algorithm)
- Added `req.socket.setTimeout(0)` to prevent socket timeouts during long processing
- Added `X-Accel-Buffering: no` header to disable proxy buffering
- Added initial progress event (0 / N queries) sent immediately when processing starts
- Frontend now correctly receives and displays live progress updates during CSV processing
- Progress bar updates show current query, queries processed, queries per second, and estimated time remaining
- Each keyword's progress now appears immediately after it's processed, not at the end

**November 15, 2025 - Real-Time Progress Tracking:**
- Added Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming endpoint `/api/process-csv-stream` for real-time progress updates
- Processing status now shows exactly which keyword is being processed (e.g., "Processing 3 out of 10")
- Live updates include:
  - Current keyword being searched
  - Number of keywords processed vs total (e.g., "3 / 10 queries")
  - Processing speed (queries per second)
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Current page being fetched from Google Places API
  - Total API calls made
- Progress bar updates in real-time as each keyword is processed
- Frontend uses streaming fetch API to consume SSE events and update UI instantly
- Backend sends progress updates before and after each keyword search
- Maintained backward compatibility with old `/api/process-csv` endpoint

**November 15, 2025 - Enhanced File Upload Preview:**
- CSV file preview now shows ALL uploaded data instead of just first 5 rows
- Added "Show More" / "Show Less" toggle button for expandable preview
  - Initially shows first 5 keywords for quick overview
  - Click "Show More" to expand and view all uploaded keywords
  - Shows count of remaining keywords (e.g., "Show More (45 more)")
- Added keyword count display showing total number of keywords uploaded
- Preview automatically filters empty rows for cleaner display
- Maximum preview height set to prevent overwhelming UI with large files

**November 15, 2025 - "Brand not found" Preview & Download Enhancement:**
- Updated results preview to show "Brand not found" for queries without any brand matches
- When a query has no brand match (all brand_match values are false), it now displays:
  - Title: "Brand not found" (instead of showing position 1 non-matching result)
  - Query: The original search query used
  - Ranking Position: "N/A" (instead of showing position number)
- Backend creates "Brand not found" entries with N/A ranking for queries without matches
- Frontend preview logic prioritizes showing these N/A entries over regular non-matching results
- Both download options (All Data & Matches Only) now include "Brand not found" entries
- Ensures users immediately know which queries didn't find their brand in both preview and downloads

**November 15, 2025 - N/A Ranking Support & Language Selector:**
- Added "N/A" display for queries without brand match rankings
- All uploaded queries now appear in results, even if no brand match is found
- Backend tracks brand matches and adds N/A entries for queries without results
- Preview display shows all queries with best ranking or N/A
- "Matches Only" download includes all queries grouped by best ranking (or N/A)
- Added language dropdown selector with 192+ languages (ISO codes) for precise search results
- Language parameter (hl) now passed to Serper API alongside country (gl) parameter
- Created client/src/lib/languages.ts with comprehensive language data structure
- Updated Dashboard component to include language selection with default to English (en)
- Backend routes.ts updated to accept and use language parameter in API calls
- Successfully imported project from GitHub repository as a fresh clone
- Installed all npm dependencies (492 packages)
- Vite configuration already includes `allowedHosts: true` for Replit proxy compatibility
- Server configured to run on 0.0.0.0:5000 (frontend) with proper host settings
- Configured development workflow (`npm run dev`) with webview output on port 5000
- Requested and configured SERPER_API_KEY environment secret for Google Places API
- Configured deployment for autoscale deployment target with build and run commands
- Application fully tested and working: CSV upload interface with country and language selectors
- Database support available (Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL schema defined) but currently using in-memory storage
- Ready for production deployment with all Replit configurations in place

**January 6, 2025 - Backend Integration & Migration:**
